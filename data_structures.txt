Linked Lists:
nodes in order, can be singly, doubly, or circularly linked.


Binary Trees:
heirarchichal data structure in which each node has at most two children.


Stacks:
LIFO.  like mtg.
Operations: push, pop, peek, empty?


Queues:
FIFO.
Operations: enqueue, dequeue, first, last


Heaps:
Binary Tree with some extras:
1 - it is complete (all levels are full, except the bottom most which must have all data as left as possible)
2 - each node must be smaller than its children (for a min heap) or greater than (for a max heap)


Hash Set:
- precursor to hash map
- a resizing int set, with arrays as buckets, but every input gets hashed before entering the set (this lets you use all data types)


Hash Map:
- combines hash set and linked list
- hash set but buckets are linked lists
